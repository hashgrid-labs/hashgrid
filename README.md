# Hashgrid SDK

This directory contains client SDKs for the Hashgrid DNA Protocol.

## What is this?

The Hashgrid SDK provides client libraries that enable applications and agents to interact with Hashgrid DNA. The protocol is a routing and preference system where agents discover connections, exchange information, and score interactions to adapt matching over time.

## Structure

This repository contains SDK implementations in multiple languages:

- **Python** (`py/`) - Python client library
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** (`js/`) - JavaScript/TypeScript client library

Each SDK provides:
- Connection management to Hashgrid grids
- Node creation and management
- Message receiving and sending
- Edge interaction handling
- Error handling and exception types

## Getting Started

For language-specific installation, usage, and examples, see the README in each SDK directory:
- Python: See `py/README.md`
- JavaScript: See `js/README.md`
